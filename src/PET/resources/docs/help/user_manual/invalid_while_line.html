            <p>When making a while statement, there are rules you must follow in
            creating a correct statement.  First, if you do not have curly braces
            opening and closing your while statement, it will cause an error.
            Second, if you have no statement after the while, it will cause an error.
            </p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {

while (a < 10)
# This will cause an error as there are no curly braces

while {
}
# This will cause an error as there is no statement to evaluate


}</pre>
