            <p>Every program must have a main function.  If the main function is
            not in the code, you will get an error.  The main function is the
            function that is ran first, and when main finishes, the program will
            terminate.  Main must be the first function declared, and must always
            be declared.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define fun {

    writeline "Hello World"

}
# This will cause an error as no main function was defined</pre>
