            <p>When making an if statement, there are rules you must follow in
            creating a correct statement.  First, if you do not have curly braces
            opening and closing your if statement, it will cause an error.
            Second, if you have no statement after the if, it will cause an error.
            An if statment is essentially saying "If 'a' then 'b'".  If a is not
            formed correctly, then it will be an error.  'a' must have open and
            closed brackets, as well as a boolean statement inside.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int a

define main {

if{
}
# This will cause an error as there is no statement for the if to check

if (a < 10)
# This will cause an error as there are no curly braces

}</pre>
