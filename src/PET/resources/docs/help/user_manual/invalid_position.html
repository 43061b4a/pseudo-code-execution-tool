            <p>When declaring integers, strings, and arrays, they must be declared
            before the first function is declared.  Since main is always the first
            function, they must be before main.  When declaring a function, you must
            declare it after main.  You cannot declare a function inside of another
            function.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {

define fun {

}
# This will cause an error as functions cannot be declared in another function

}

int a
# This will cause an error as integers cannot be declared after the first function
