            <p>When declaring an integer, you must be sure to use correct syntax.
            To declare an integer, you must use a correct name.  This means that
            you can only use upper and lower case letters, as well as
            underscores.  When declaring multiple integers, you must use a comma
            to seperate each seperate variable.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int
# This will cause an error as there is no name for the integer

int a2
# This will cause an error as there is a number in the name

int a b c
# This will cause an error as there are no commas between the seperate functions

define main {
