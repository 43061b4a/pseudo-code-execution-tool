            <p>When writing to the terminal, you must enclose what you wish to
            write within quotation marks.  Quotation marks must always come in
            pairs, and if you are missing a paired quotation, you will get an
            error.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {

Write "Hello World
# This will cause an error as you are missing the end quote

Write "Hello World""
# This will cause an error as the last quote is missing a paired quote

}</pre>
