            <p>You have tried to call a function that has not been defined.
            In order call a function, you must make sure that you have defined
            it in your code.  A frequent error is a spelling
            mistake in either your definition or your call to the function.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {

    call PrintOut 
    # This will cause an error as there is no function named PrintOut
    # What was probably meant was to call PrintOt, or to have defined
    # the function as PrintOut

    call WriteOut
    # This will cause an error as there is no function named WriteOut
    # It needs to be defined before it can be called
}

define PrintOt{

    WriteLine "Hello World!"
