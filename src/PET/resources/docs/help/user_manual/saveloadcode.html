            <p><i>Saving</i> code is storing it on the hard drive so that it can be retrieved later.  <i>Loading</i> code is retrieving it after a save.
			Whenever you want to save your code, you can do so in two ways: you can click on the disk icon near the top of 
			the window, shown here:</p>
			
			<img src="img/diskoutlined.jpg"/>

			<p>Or, you can do so from the File menu, shown here. </p>

			<img src="img/filesaveoutlined.png"/>

			<p>In the file menu, there are two options for saving: <i>save</i> and <i>save as</i>.  Save as will allow you to specify a new file name 
			and location on the disk when saving.  Save uses the last file name and location that the file was saved as.  
			The disk button at the top of the screen works like the save choice.</p>

			<p>When you want to load a file, you do so from the File menu, shown above.  For loading code, choose the <i>Open</i> menu item.</p>
