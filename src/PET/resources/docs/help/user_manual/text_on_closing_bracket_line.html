            <p>When closing a bracket, whether it is in a function or a while loop
            or if statement, the closing bracket must be on a line by itself.  It
            there is anything on the line with the closing bracket it will cause
            an error.  This is to promote good syntax.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {


} WriteLine "Hello World"
# This will cause an error because the WriteLine statement is on the same line as
# the bracket
</pre>
