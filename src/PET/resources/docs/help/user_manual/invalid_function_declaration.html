            <p>When defining a function, you must remember some things in order
            to correctly define it.  You must always have a function name,
            you must always have round open and close brackets, and you must
            always have an open bracket after the function name.  When creating
            the function name, be sure you only use upper or lower case letters,
            or an underscore.  Numbers and symbols are not allowed.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {


}

define {
}
# This will cause an error as there is no function name


define fun
# This will cause an error as there are no curly braces

define fun2 {
}
# This will cause an error as numbers are not allowed in function
# names
