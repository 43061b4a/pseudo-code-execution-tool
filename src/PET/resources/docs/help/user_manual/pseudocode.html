            <p><i>Pseudocode</i> is a program written in easy-to-read english, rather than in a programming language that can be 
			understood by a computer, but is harder for a human to read and understand.  </p>

			<p>Generally, before a programmer begins writing a program, they will write it out in pseudocode to help them plan 
			and design the program.  Writing this easy to read pseudocode is a big help to programmers in figuring out what needs to be done, 
			how to do it, and what order to do it in.</p>

			<p>However, this program executes the psuedocode you write for you, so you don't have to 'translate' 
			it from pseudocode into real code.</p>
