        <p>The Read command is used to capture input from the user and store it in a variable.  Read supports
            all of the variable types that PET offers.  When entering input it is important to be sure
            that what is being entered is appropriate for what variable it is going to be stored in.  A
            runtime error will occur if the input is not valid.  For reading into a boolean will error
            on any input that doesn't match 'true' or 'false' exactly (without the ').  Example syntax below.</p>

        <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
        <pre class="code">
# declare some variables
array my_array[10]
int my_int
string my_string
bool my_bool

# the main function
define main {

	# read into the variables
	Read my_array[0]
	Read my_int
	Read my_string
	Read my_bool

    # tell the user what they entered
	WriteLine "You entered" my_array[0] ", " my_int ", " my_string ", " my_bool
