        <p>Comments can be inserted into your code to help others and yourself to understand what 
            you are doing when reading the code.  Comments are indicated using the # symbol.
            A comment can be on a line of its own or can appear after a line containing code.
            Any text following a # symbol will be ignored by the compiler.</p>
