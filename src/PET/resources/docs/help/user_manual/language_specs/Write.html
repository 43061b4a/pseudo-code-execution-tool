        <p>The Write and WriteLine commands are used to print to the terminal.  Write takes space separated
            arguments.  It will append a space to the start of a variables value when printing it.  The
            difference between Write and WriteLine is that WriteLine will write a newline character at after
            all of its arguments.  This will force the content of the next Write command to appear on a new line.
            WriteLine can also be called with no arguments in which case it will only print the new line 
            character. </p>
