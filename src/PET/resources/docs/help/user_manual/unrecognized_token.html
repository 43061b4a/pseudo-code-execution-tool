            <p>Unrecognized token is a very common error.  If you have mispelled
            a variable name when trying to call it, you will get unrecognized token.
            If you have symbols where they are not supposed to be, like ! or $, then
            you will get an unrecognized token.  Essentially, if you have an error
            and it is not some form of specifif error, then you have a syntax error,
            which is picked up as an unrecognized token.</p>
