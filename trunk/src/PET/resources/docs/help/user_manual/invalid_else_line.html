            <h1 class="sub_title">Invalid Else Line</h1>

            <p>There are multiple ways to have an invalid else line.
            The first way is that if you have an else statement without an
            if, it will not work.  Secondly, if you have anything after the word
            else other than the opening bracket, it is an error.  Finally,
            if you do not have an opening bracket for the else statement, it
            is an error.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int i

define main {

i = 5

else {
}
# This will cause an error as it has no if statement

if(i > 10){
}
else if(i < 10) {
}
# This will cause an error as there is more than just an opening
# brace after the else.  PET does not handle else if statements

if(i > 10){
}
else
# This will cause an error as there are no brackets at all
