            <p>When making any function, loop, or if statement, you must have
            closing brackets for each open bracket.  If you are missing the
            closing bracket, PET will show you the line with the free open bracket.
            However, sometimes you could have missed a bracket in a loop in a function,
            and the bracket at the end of the function will close the loop instead
            of the function.  Make sure you trace your brackets carefully when you
            are missing a bracket.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
define main {

    while(a < 10){
    # This will cause an error as your while is missing a closing bracket, although
    # PET will tell you that main is missing the closing bracket.
    
}</pre>
