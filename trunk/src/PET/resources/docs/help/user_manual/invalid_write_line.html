            <p>When writing a line, you must make sure you use proper syntax.  A
            write line can include any variables, as long as they are space seperated,
            as long with character except for a double quotation mark as long as
            it is inside two quotation marks.  If you try and write anything outside
            of quotes that CANNOT be valid variables, such as symbols and numbers,
            you have an invalid write.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int a, b, c

define main {

    Write 34
    # This will cause an error, as 34 is not a valid variable.  To write the number
    # 34, you need to type Write "34"

    Write %$#
    # This will cause an error, as %$# is not a valid variable.

    Write d
    # This will cause an Unrecognized Token error, as d could be a variable, but it
    # is not defined.  Read the unrecognized token error page for more information
