            <p>A mistake has been made in array declaration.  When declaring
            an array, it must be of the form "array name[#]" where the # is
            any number greater-than or equal to 0, and name is any
            letter character without spaces.  If you have no number, are
            missing brackets, have no name, or have characters after the closing
            brace, then you will have an invalid array declaration.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
array test[]
# This will cause an error as there is no size
array test20
# This will cause an error as there are no brackets
array
# This will cause an error as no array was declared
array test[20]hi
# This will cause an error as no characters can appear after the closing
# brace

define main {
