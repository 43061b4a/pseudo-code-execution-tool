            <p>When decalring any variable, whether it is an int, array, or function,
            you must only use variable names that are not used elsewhere by the
            program.  For example, you cannot have an integer named if, or an
            array named while.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int while
# This will cause an error, as while is already used

define main {


}

define define {

}
# This will cause an error as define is already used, and cannot be a function
