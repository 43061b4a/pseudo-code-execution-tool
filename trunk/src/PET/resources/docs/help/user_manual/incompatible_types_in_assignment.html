            <h1 class="sub_title">Incompatible Types in Assignment</h1>

            <p>You have defined a variable to be one type but have tried
            to assign it another type.  For example, if you defined value
            to be an int, and then tried to set value to true, it would cause
            an error because true is not a number, it is a conditional.  When
            defining and using variables, make sure you use the correct types.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
int i

define main{

    i = true
    # This will cause an error as a number is expected for i
    # but it finds the conditional true

}</pre>
