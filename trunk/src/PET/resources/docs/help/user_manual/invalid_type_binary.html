            <p>When using binary operators you must be applied to the same types.
            When using using ==, you must make sure that you have the same types on
            both sides of the equal sign.</p>

            <pre class="code">
bool a
int b

define main {

if( a == b) {

}
# This will cause an error as a is a bool and b is an int, which are conflicting
# types
