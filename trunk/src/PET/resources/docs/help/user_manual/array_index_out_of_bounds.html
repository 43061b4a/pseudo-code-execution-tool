            <p>The index of the array is out of bounds.  This means
            that you are trying to access a piece of your array
            that is outside of the defined size of the array.  For
            example, if you make an array of size 10, it will make
            array indexes 0 - 9 open to access.  If you then try
            to access an array index above 9, it will be out of bounds.</p>

            <h1 class="special">Code:</h1>
            <pre class="code">
array numbers[10]

define main {

    numbers[20] = 4
    # This will cause your error, as array index
    # 20 is not defined
    
}</pre>
