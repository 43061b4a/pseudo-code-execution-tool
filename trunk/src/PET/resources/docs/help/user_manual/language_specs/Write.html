        <p>The write and writeline commands are used to print to the terminal.  write takes space separated
            arguments.  It will append a space to the start of a variable's value when printing it.  The
            difference between write and writeline is that writeline will write a newline character after
            all of its arguments.  This will force the content of the next write command to appear on a new line.
            writeline can also be called with no arguments in which case it will only print the new line
            character. i.e. a blank line will appear. </p>
